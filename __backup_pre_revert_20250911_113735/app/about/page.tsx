      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p>Hi lovely,</p>

      <p>
        My spiritual journey began with my beloved Nan, Annie, who opened my eyes to the
        magic of crystals and intention. I&apos;ll never forget visiting her sister in
        Bristol, where we discovered my first crystals at a market in an old church -
        Clear Quartz, Rose Quartz, Green Aventurine, and a salt rock lamp that taught me
        about cleansing energy and healing frequencies. Those early lessons planted seeds
        that would bloom into something beautiful years later.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my late teens, whilst struggling with ADHD and depression, I found solace in
        meditation, journalling with my crystals, and creating my own candles for personal
        rituals. This practice became my anchor, especially after becoming a single mum to
        my son Leo at 18. Watching him navigate the world with autism showed me an even
        higher purpose - to build not just a business, but the best possible life for us
        both whilst creating something meaningful for others seeking their own path to
        healing.
      </p>

      <p>
        That&apos;s how Ashora was born. Every candle I hand-pour is crafted with pure
        intention, completing specific rituals for each unique purpose - whether you&apos;re
        manifesting love, seeking protection, attracting wealth, or finding peace. Using
        only premium vegan ingredients in recyclable jars, each candle represents my
        commitment to both your spiritual journey and our planet&apos;s wellbeing.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe your higher self - that most unlocked, happy, free version of you -
        deserves nothing less than products that align with your deepest values.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you light an Ashora candle, you&apos;re not just burning wax - you&apos;re
        igniting possibility. You&apos;re joining a community of souls committed to
        building better lives whilst caring for our earth. And soon, you&apos;ll be
        collecting beautiful affirmation cards that remind you of your own magic every
        single day.
      </p>

      <p>Welcome to Ashora, lovely. Let&apos;s find your magic together.</p>

      <p>With love &amp; intention,<br/>Caitlin x</p>
